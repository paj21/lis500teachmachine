        <h2>What Shoes Are You Wearing?</h2>
        <img src="../images/ml model.png">
        <p>We have trained an AI model to guess what kind of shoe it is being presented with. The user would put a shoe up to their camera, and the model would put the shoe into one of ten categories:</p>
        <p><b>Categories:</b> Boots, Cleats, Crocs, Dress Shoes, Flats, Heels, Loafers, Running Shoes, Sandals, Slippers</p>
        <br>
        <p>The model is trained from images of 5-8 different shoes for each category, with 4-7 images per shoe. The images were taken from the Designer Shoe Warehouse (DSW) website.</p>
        <p>To learn more about the model, go to the Project Statement page.</p>
