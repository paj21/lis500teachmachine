        <!-- ABOUT PARKER -->
        <h2>Parker Johnston:</h2>
        <p>I'm Parker, a UW-Madison senior studying Computer Science and Information Science. I have always been known as a "music and tech" guy. To describe what that means, I have two guitars and a ukulele spread around my small apartment in order to have the easiest access possible to an instrument so I can start having a jam session. My apartment is also filled with many little gadgets and screens, as well as "cord jungles" hidden as best as I can. As a friend-proclaimed tech guy, I am taking LIS 500 to get a better look of what the tech industry looks like from a human perspective.

        <!-- ABOUT DAVID -->
        <h2>David Giardino:</h2>
        <p>My name is David Giardino, I am a UW-Madison senior studying Data Science and Information science. I was raised in Ann Arbor Michigan but I moved to Rhode Island in 7th grade. At UW Madison I work for the Women's Basketball Team as a manager and am also a part of the student radio where I have a music show and a sports show. I love music both watching and playing, I have played guitar for 7 years and bass for 4. I also love live music. I chose to take this course because it is a requirement for the information science major but it is also an intersection between my interests in data and social justice. I have really enjoyed the ethics based classes I have taken so far so I am very excited for what this class has to offer.

        <!-- ABOUT MINH -->
        <h2>Minh Vu:</h2>
        <p>Hello, i'm Minh and I am a UW-Madison senior majoring in Information Science with a certificate in Computer Science. I was born and raised in Madison, Wisconsin so of course I am a big fan of the Green Bay Packers. I enjoy playing/watching sports, playing video games, traveling, and hanging out with friends and family. Watching Youtube is also another hobby of mine and since I am a tech person, I do enjoy watching Marques Brownlee. I chose to take LIS 500 because I needed this course for my major and I thought it would be an interesting course based on what I read about it online.
